# SwiftUI

Brian Voong's tutorials are really helpful. This code references one his videos called "[SwiftUI Fetching JSON and Image Data with BindableObject][1]".

`BindableObject` has been replaced with `ObservableObject` as noted in [iOS 13 Release Notes][2]:

> BindableObject is replaced by the ObservableObject protocol from the Combine framework. (50800624)

This follows Brian's tutorial, but replaces `BindableObject` with `ObservableObject`.
